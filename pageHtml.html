		The machines are about to start a revolution. But this time, we might well be the victims. Full automation of weapons is on the way.
	<br></br>

In any case, we're now witnessing an unprecedented proliferation of<a class="color1"> weapons technology. </a>They include more bombs, weapons of mass destruction, advanced weapons like the Taser and Munition Cannon, and weapons that aren't just about<a class="color1"> fighting </a>but whoopees like the US Strategic Missile Treaty, as well as nuclear weapons.
<br></br>
A few dozen of these weapons are now available. In the US we can manufacture more, using the same production systems as in Pakistan where we produced the ICBMs. These weapons should be on the move with increased precision and reliability.
<br></br>
They will soon have<a class="color1"> nuclear weapons. </a>According to Wikipedia, these<a class="color1"> non-nuclear weapons </a>are: a <a class="color2">"black, highly explosive ballistic missile, an unguided nuclear weapon, or a single, unguided, or highly accurate semi-guided weapon.</a> That makes these<a class="color1"> weapons </a>a new type of warhead and a<a class="color1"> weapon </a>as far as they belong—or are they as far beyond that as the use of the concept of<a class="color1"> warships </a>and of<a class="color1"> nuclear energy</a>.
<br></br>
The idea that these weapons exist is a logical fallacious one, but it is based on history and it is the most widely-known and hotly disputed piece of evidence that the war in Iraq is a proxy war between Saddam Hussein and Islamic State (ISIS) rebels that both use weapons of mass destruction against innocent Syrians (such as chlorine gas).
